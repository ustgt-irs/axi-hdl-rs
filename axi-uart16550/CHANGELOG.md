# [unreleased]

# [v0.3.1] 2026-08-13

- Fixed bug in TX interrupt handler where data could be read from the FIFO when none
  was available

# [v0.3.0] 2026-08-13

- TX Async implementation was optimized and now uses three atomic types instead of a mutex
  guarded context structure
- Removed `unsafe` for Async TX constructor again, the special case does not warrant an `unsafe`
  attribute.
- Adds optional `portable-atomic` feature for portable atomic operations
- Fixed `Rx` reading the RX FIFO trigger level back from the write-only FIFO Control register,
  which returned garbage instead of the configured trigger level. The trigger level is now
  tracked locally.
- Fixed a use-after-cancellation issue where a dropped `TxFuture` left a stale buffer pointer
  in its waker slot, which a spurious or later interrupt could dereference.
- Renamed the `registers` module to `regs`; register field types now live in `regs::fields`.
- Re-export `InterruptEnable`, `InterruptIdentification`, `InterruptId2`, `LineStatus`,
  `RxFifoTrigger`, `WordLen` and `StopBits` at the crate root, since they appear in the public
  API.
- Added an optional `defmt` feature implementing `defmt::Format` for this crate's register and
  error types.

# [v0.2.1] 2026-06-08

- Fix for MSRV: v1.87.

# [v0.2.0] 2026-06-08

- TX futures borrow buffer for their lifetime now.
- Constructor is now `unsafe`.
- Async TX write method now returns a future.

# [v0.1.0] 2025-11-28

Initial release.
