# [unreleased]

# [v0.3.0] 2026-08-12

- TX Async implementation was optimized and now uses three atomic types instead of a mutex
  guarded context structure
- Removed `unsafe` for Async TX constructor again, the special case does not warrant an `unsafe`
  attribute.
- Adds optional `portable-atomic` feature for portable atomic operations
- Renamed the `registers` module to `regs`; register field types now live in `regs::fields`.
- Re-export `Status` at the crate root, since it appears in the public API.
- Added an optional `defmt` feature implementing `defmt::Format` for this crate's register and
  error types.

# [v0.2.1] 2026-06-08

- Fix for MSRV: v1.87.

# [v0.2.0] 2026-06-08

- TX futures borrow buffer for their lifetime now.
